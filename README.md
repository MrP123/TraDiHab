# TraDiHab

## Description
This is the embedded software for the TraDiHab project (Trainings- und Diagnosesystem zur häuslichen Rehabilitation der oberen Extremität bei Schlaganfallpatienten) founded by the AWS.
It has not been modified since the end of the project in late 2019 - early 2020, but it was ported to PlatformIO for easier maintenance.
