## Description
This is the embedded software for the TraDiHab project (Trainings- und Diagnosesystem zur häuslichen Rehabilitation der oberen Extremität bei Schlaganfallpatienten) founded by the AWS.
It has not been modified since the end of the project in late 2019 - early 2020, but it was ported to PlatformIO for easier maintenance.

## Where has it been used
This software has been used in the original project, as well as for carrying out measurements and analysis in the process of the following publication:
