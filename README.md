# TraDiHab

## Description
This is the embedded software for the TraDiHab project (Trainings- und Diagnosesystem zur häuslichen Rehabilitation der oberen Extremität bei Schlaganfallpatienten).
It has not been modified since the end of the project in early 2020, but it was ported to PlatformIO for easier maintenance.
